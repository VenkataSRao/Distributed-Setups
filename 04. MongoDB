Background:
===========
Install mongodb in clustered environment..

mongodb version - mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.0.6

Steps to setup:


Step1:
=====
wget https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.0.6.tgz 

tar -zxvf mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.0.6.tgz

Step2:
======
edit mongod.conf file below properties..
logpath=/path/to/mongo/log
port=27019
dbpath=/path/to/mongo/data
nojournal=true
httpinterface=true ( If you want web to be enabled..)
replSet=my_mongo_dev ( Most importnat.. because all other nodes will join with this property)

Copy this mongod.conf file to all instance of mongo ( Suppose if we are installing in 5 machines, need to copy this conf
file in 5 machines )

Step3:
======
Start Services

mongod --dbpath /path/to/mongo/data --config /path/to/location/mongo/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.0.6/conf/mongod.conf &"

Need to start services on all boxes ( Here we took 5 boxes )


Step4:
=======
go into one of the box ( be in mongo shell )

rs.initiate();
rs.add("hostname1:27019")
rs.add("hostname2:27019")
rs.add("hostname3:27019")
rs.add("hostname4:27019")

Step4:
======
Within 5 machines one will be primary and others will be seondary machines..
Login to any of the boxes and start using mongo

also login to web and check whether howmnay nodes are healthy


http://primary_IP:28017/ ( if you are using default mongo port 27017)
http://primary_IP:28019/ ( If you are using other than default port )

Step5:
======
Stop services

pkill -f mongod

It will kills mongo


Important Note: ( Observation)
==============================

1. From primary node only user can write data to mongo
2. From primary node only user can add or remove nodes
3. Fron secondary, user can read data only.. and can not write
4. every time user logs into secondary node, user has to say
    rs.slaveOk ( this command will allow to fetch data from master, this is active till session is live.. if user exists 
                  session and logins then again use has to say SlaveOK)
                  
                  
                  

That's It... ! Mongo cluster is ready.. :-)

Happy Learning.. Keep Learning.... :-)
