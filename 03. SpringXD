Back ground:
============

Install and setup soringXD in distributed fashion.. we planned to setup in five machines..

in which one is admin machine, from which will operate all remaining 4 machines..


Components required:
====================
SpringXD 1.2.0 RELEASE
ZooKeeper
redis
activemq
mysql
 
Steps:
=======

Step 1: First setup zookeeper in four machines..

Step 2: download springxd software in admin machine..

Step 3: Edit servers.yml file ( edit below properties )
          trasport bus : redis
          ( Select redis and give IP where redis is runnin )
          ( Select database as mysql and give ip and hostname where mysql is running )
          ( Provide zooKeeper details like ip and port, where zookeeper is running )
          
  Step 4: copy this springxd software from admin machine to all other machines..
  
  Note: Before starting springxd, all dependent components should be up and running..
  
  Step 5: Then start admin services from any machine, so admin will get started..
  
  Step 5: Start containers in different boxes..
  
  Important Note:
             when ever if we start something, it will get registered with zookeeper.. so if we start containers in different
            machines , again those will register with zookeeper.. hence through zookeeper component.. admin will come to know
            where is container running and containers will come to know where is admin running..
            
            
             
Conclusion: This way we can set up sprdingxd in distributed fashion.. servers.yml is key property file in which will mention 
all machines details..

Happy Learning.. -)
